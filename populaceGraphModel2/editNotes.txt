Changing the way social distancing is implemented, because as is un-repairably faulty distancing_reduction is an edge quality, not a node quality. Therefore, it must be set up per environment, per edge

created partitioners.py to store partitioning infrastructure. Overengineered? perhaps, but here is why
an enumerator for age, fine,  but using an enumerator to partition income
just seemed silly and inefficient. So I edited it to take lambda functions and bin lists 
but the lambda functions wouldn't pickle. 
so I created an inheritence structure so that whatever partitioner is desired can be easily created and implemented, 
all after quite an incessant argument about the best data structure for this problem  I had with me amigo. 
The biggest downside is that the docstrings don't inherit. 

the populace is now a numpy records list. This has a few advantages:
records are easily referenced, which means now instead of needing to pass a list of indexes to represent a set of people, 
and storing a reference to the entire populace, everywhere, it is only necessary to pass references to the members. 
this cleans the syntax up a bit. 
the partition now lists record references to each bin 
The record list can be easily converted back to a dataframe for grouping. 
However, pops_by_category is still done by index,  This is because for some reason every other method is very slow
for such a large population, it can be very cumbersome to produce a list with each person for each attribute
not sure the issue, was hell to try and debug, but whatever....

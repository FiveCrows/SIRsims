Install and run the code: 
Starting from the current folder that contains this file: 

1) make
2) Edit "run_multi_leon_sims_1.py" and 
   (a) change the project number 
   (b) specificy the nb_repeat_runs (for randomization)
   (c) specify search grid (follow template below). To find out the 
       allowable parameters, type "./seir --help" on the command line. 

    search_params['muinv'] = [3.0]
    search_params['R0'] = [2., 2.5, 3.0]

2) Run the script:  
      python first_time_setup.py

3) Run the script:  
      python run_multi_leon_sims_1.py

4) Run analysis script
   (a) Edit the script and change the project number
   (b) Run the script: 
       python plot_multi_generation_times.py

Strong suggestion: copy the plotting/analysis scripts you want into the 
src/ folder under the appropriate project number. Different projects will 
require different scripts. 

Beware: scripts that run from the root directory will not run from within 
the project without manually editing the script. This will be automated at 
some point. Not today. 

Beware: the plotting script uses various global variables. They will not be in 
the global_dict UNLESS you define them in search_params. So defining them all in 
a file that is imported prior to running the script is best. The reason is 
that while the variables in parameters_0.txt are automatically included in 
the global_dict, the same is not true for additional parameters I use.  Why? 
Because I did not wish to modify the structure of the input file.

C++ version of NHB code. 
This will be followed by a Julia version, perhaps developed in class this Spring.

- Allow for floating dt for higher accuracy. 
  It is not clear how small dt must be to get accuracy to within 5%. 
  Approximating 1-exp(-beta*dt) by beta*dt is one source of approximation, 
  but is not clear whether the exponential form leads to errors and this must be tested.

260 people initially infected. 
Random vaccination of susceptible people. 

1 vaccination daily 
No vaccinations (85): 
nb recovered: 189531

100 vaccinations daily: 
nb recovered: 188609
nb vaccinations: 7000 (almost no effect)

1000 vaccinations daily: 
total number recovered:  180754 (70% of pop)
total number vacc 1:  70752 (27% of pop)

10000 vaccinations daily: 
total number recovered:  108747 (41% of pop)
total number vacc 1:  151795 (58% of population)
Execution time 6 seconds

20000 vaccinations daily: 
total number recovered:  51159 (20% of pop)
nb vaccinated_1: 209383 (80% of pop)
Execution time 6 seconds

So to be more realistic, I should make vaccines 70% effective (regarding transmission rate), and allocate the second dose a fixe time after the first dose, and make the second dose 95% effective. For now, every iteration, I allocate a number of vaccines specified by a Poisson distribution with a mean set to a mean rate that is input into the parameters_0.txt file.

Implemented Vaccines. Give vaccine at a fixed rate over time. 1st dose, 2nd dose. 
For now, effect is 100%. 2nd dose has no effect. V1 state has no transmissibility. 

What is \beta and what is \gamma. 
\beta is transmissibility (infectiousness). It affects the degree to which I can transmit the disease to 
somebody else. The vaccine will decrease \beta. Will make me less infectuous. That would decrease \beta. Thus, 
the probability of infecting somebody else is decreased. 
The vaccine will also make me less likely to catch the disease by boosting my immune system. That means that each 
person should have an "antigen" parameter in [0,1].

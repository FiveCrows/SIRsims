First run with slim=True. 
3 simulations (runGauntlet 3 times) for each case. 
tau=0.2, gamma=0.1 (the recovery should probably be 0.2) (constant values)

def runGauntlet(count):
  for avg_efficacy in [0., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75]:
     for std_efficacy in [0., 0.3, 0.6]:
       for adoption in [0.0, 0.5, 1.]:  # masks and social distancing in schools and workplaces

Save to git

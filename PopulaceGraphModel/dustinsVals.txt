Social Distancing
<1m, chance of infection: 12.8%
≥1m, chance of infection: 2.6%
Results: ~79.69% reduction in infection rate
    • ~80% of people are actively practicing social distancing (seems high)
        ◦ high variance, some say 58%, some say 77%
        ◦ average of ~71.67%

Face mask vs. no face mask
Without face mask, chance of infection: 17.4%
With face mask, chance of infection: 3.1%
Results: ~82.18% reduction in infection rate
    • CDC reports that 74.1% of people make an effort to wear a mask
        ◦ other sites report an average of around 61.5%, 60%,
        ◦ average of 65.2%

Eye protection vs. no eye protection
Without eye protection, chance of infection: 16.0%
With eye protection, chance of infection: 5.5%
Results: ~65.63% reduction in infection rate
    • Unable to find a study/article that shows how many people are wearing face shields; might be largely limited to those in high-risk settings (doctors, nurses, etc.)

Hand Washing
Without washing hands, chance of infection: N/A (Depends on how much people are touching their face)
Washing hands, chance of infection: N/A
Results: can reduce the rate of infection by 16%. (Another study shows 21%, average: 18.5%)
    • Less than 1% (~0.9%) of those monitored complied completely with the hospital’s handwashing protocol in Ethiopia
        ◦ Other measurements showed around 0.52% in Miami and 1.7% in São Paulo, Brazil.
        ◦ average of 1.04%

the classes for building the contagion models are part of ModelToolkit.py

It must be able to load people_list_serialized.pkl,and the folder 

Contact Matrices, which contains the pickled contact matrices

The most recent script for building and simulating a model, then generating some plots with the toolkit is 

ModelToolkit.py

Many different simulations and plots can easily be built by editing ModelToolkit.py

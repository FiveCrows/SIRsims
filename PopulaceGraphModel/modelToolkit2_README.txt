Updates to modelToolkit2:
 functions and variables of the model toolkit two classes are now split that those for the intrinsic state of the system are part of the Environment classes, such as whose in the  environment, the edge picking and weight picking algorithms are now all part of Netbuilder. There are advantages to this
eters to the model, I would just give them a default value. That way the old scripts still worked, but after enough new features I start thinking the whole structure seems silly and wishing I had something more with more clear order that was much easier to use. Type errors are common in python and they give me hell because they cause runtime errors that  can be hard to identify and since python is dynamically typed, the compiler won't find them.  Piling up giant lists of parameters in all the  function signatures is recipe for a trainwreck, so I tried to avoid headaches down the line with a cleaner structure that matches the parameters as object variables rather than as arguments.

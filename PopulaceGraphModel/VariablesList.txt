Variables for picking edges: 

school, household, workplace id's, from synthetic data, to identify people in shared environments

Environment avg degrees. For School and workplace, avg number of contacts per person. Households always include every possible edge anyways.

Strogatz clustering is also called with a variable to represent portion of edges that are random. 

group contact: for picking edges more carefully 


Variables for calculating graph weights:

Environment transmission Scalars: one for each environment (school, home, worplace),
these variables are affected by how often contagion spreads in such environments

Global transmission Scalar:
Affects every weight. This variable is affected by the viral quality

Masking Scalar: 
    affects the weight by scalar if one side of edge has mask, scalar squared if both. 

Environment mask use: 
    portion of people in environment using masks


group contact: for reweighting graph
Variables for simulating graph:
Gamma: the recovery rate
Tau: the transmission weight. Has the same affect as Global Scalar





metrics for comparing and understanding results: 
These can be applied to a population as a whole, to a subpopulation, or between subpopulations (bipartite):

Sum total weight in all edges

Clustering coeff: density of triangles in graph

Avg path length (expensive to compute) 

node degree distribution

Susceptible, infected, recovered vs time 

final susceptible, Infected, Recovered

contact: sum total weight per person
